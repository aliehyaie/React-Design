  allows us to easily set up Git hooks to automate tasks at various points in our development workflow.Inside the "
  husky" folder, you'll find configuration files such as `pre-commit`. These file specify the tasks or scripts that
  should be executed before a commit is performed.

- **components**: The "components" folder serves as the central location for all the reusable UI components in this
  project. It follows a modular approach, where each component is contained within its own folder and has a dedicated
  file for its implementation.

    - ### Accordion Component
      The Accordion component is a versatile and customizable UI element for creating collapsible sections. It allows
      you to display content in an organized and space-efficient manner. With the Accordion component, you can create
      nested accordions and customize their appearance using CSS classes.
